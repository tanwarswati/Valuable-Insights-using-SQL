# Valuable-Insights-using-SQL
Here I have used three datasets to make the project on SQL. Dataset named as Superstore(kaggle), Netflix(Tableau) and World Military Power(Kaggle).
## Tool Used : Microsoft SQL Server
### Super Store Sales Insights
- Utilized common table expressions (CTEs) to analyze year-on-year growth of sales.
- Implemented queries to remove duplicate rows and ensure data integrity.
- Generated comprehensive sales insights and reports to support business decision-making.
### Netflix Data Analysis
- Leveraged SQL queries to display ranks of content based on release dates within specified year ranges.
- Identified top actors on Netflix with the most movies in the last five years up to 2020 using DENSE_RANK and PARTITION BY window functions.
- Analyzed actors with the most TV shows in the last five years till 2020, applying advanced SQL techniques to extract meaningful insights.
### World Military Power Analysis
- Analyzed global military strength to rank the top 30 countries, revealing India at 25th place.
